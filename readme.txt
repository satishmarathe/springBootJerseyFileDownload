This project is created from spring boot.
This project is about jersey rest service.
We are trying to demonstrate how we can expose a rest service end point which will give a file as an output.

As a sidenote we are also including it under GIT control and then will be uploading it to GITHub.
Note - these are simple examples
Note - we are using SSH to push changes without the need of providing credentials again and again.
Now we will begin with changes.
